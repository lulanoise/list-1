# Exercise: lists 1
* define a testing class with a `main()` method where you:
    * create a **not mutable** `List` of strings called `cityNames` using `asList()` that you populate with 3 city names
    * try to add a 4th city name at the end of the `List`
      * if you get an exception, try to understand why and eventually comment the faulty code
    * try to change the 2nd item of the array, entering the value `Tegucigalpa`
    * print the content of `cityNames`
    * define a **mutable empty** `List` of strings called `kingsOfRome`
    * insert the names of the [7 kings of Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Rome) into the mutable list
    * print the content of `kingsOfRome`
    * convert `kingsOfRome` into an array called `kingsOfRomeArray`, using `new String[0]` to determine the type of the array
    * change the value of the 7th king in `kingsOfRomeArray` with the value `Lucius Tarquinius Supercar`
    * print the content of `kingsOfRomeArray`
